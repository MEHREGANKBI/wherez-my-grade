# wherez-my-grade

This repo is the product of a late night automation craving. I was waiting for my last grade that would mean graduation for me. Checking my panel repeatedly statrted to become annoying so I tried to automate it since I knew there was a useful element in my panel that would make the automation much easier. 


## Disclaimer

As mentioned before, this code wasn't meant to be deployed or run for a long time on multiple machines. Spending more time adding more structure (i.e styling, comprehensive doc, and logging mechanism) to the code would provide no significant benefit to me, thus I chose to avoid spending more time improving this already simple code.

With all that said, I still logged the output by redirecting the stdout and stderr into a text file. 


*As always, feel free to let me know if you have any issues with the code using the issues tab.*
